# Streamlining Java Builds with Jenkins Automation

Implementing a Jenkins-based CI pipeline to automate the build process for a Java application with many classes. The pipeline will compile the source code, execute over 100 unit tests, and package the application into a JAR file within 5 minutes. This streamlined process ensures consistent and reliable builds, reducing manual effort and minimizing errors, ultimately improving productivity and code quality
